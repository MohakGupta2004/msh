# msh - Minimal Shell (in C)

## Overview

**`msh`** (short for *Minimal Shell*) is a simple, interactive command-line shell implemented in C. The purpose of this project is to build a minimal shell from scratch, covering basic shell functionalities such as executing commands, managing processes, and handling simple user input/output. This project is designed for learning and understanding the internal workings of a shell, such as process creation, file descriptors, and system calls in a Unix-like operating system.

This project was inspired by the [Codecrafters.io shell tutorial](https://codecrafters.io), where I learned how to implement fundamental shell features and build my own shell step by step.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: 
  - Execute system commands using `fork()` and `execvp()`.
  - Supports external commands (e.g., `ls`, `echo`, etc.).
  
- **Built-in Commands**: 
  - Supports built-in commands such as `cd` for changing directories and `exit` for terminating the shell.
  
- **Input Handling**: 
  - Reads user input using `fgets()` and processes it.
  
- **Process Management**: 
  - Executes commands in child processes using `fork()`.
  - Handles waiting for processes to finish using `waitpid()`.
  
- **Pipes and Redirection** (optional):
  - Future support for command piping (`|`) and file input/output redirection (e.g., `command > file.txt`).
  
- **Background Processes**:
  - Run commands in the background using the `&` symbol (e.g., `sleep 10 &`).
  
- **Environment Variables**:
  - Handles environment variables (e.g., `$HOME`, `$PATH`).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/msh.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd msh
   ```

3. Build the shell by compiling the source code:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. Run the shell:
   ```bash
   ./msh
   ```

---

## Usage

Once the shell is running, you will see the prompt `msh$`. You can start typing commands just like any other shell.

### Examples

- **Run a command**:
  ```sh
  msh$ ls
  ```
  This will list the files in the current directory.

- **Run a command with arguments**:
  ```sh
  msh$ echo "Hello, World!"
  ```
  This will output `Hello, World!`.

- **Change directories**:
  ```sh
  msh$ cd /path/to/directory
  ```

- **Run a command in the background**:
  ```sh
  msh$ sleep 10 &
  ```

- **Exit the shell**:
  ```sh
  msh$ exit
  ```

## How It Works

The shell follows a basic structure to process commands and interact with the user:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The shell continuously prompts for user input, reading commands using `fgets()` or `getline()`.

2. **Command Parsing**: 
   - The input is parsed to identify the command and its arguments.

3. **Process Creation**:
   - The shell uses `fork()` to create a child process.
   - In the child process, `execvp()` is used to run the command with arguments.
   - The parent process waits for the child to finish using `waitpid()`.

4. **Built-in Commands**:
   - If the command is a built-in (e.g., `cd`, `exit`), the shell executes it directly without forking a new process.

5. **Background Processes**:
   - If the command includes `&` at the end, the shell creates the child process and does not wait for it to finish.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - The shell handles errors such as command not found or invalid arguments.

## Future Features

- **Pipes**: Support for piping commands (e.g., `ls | grep txt`).
- **Redirection**: Support for file redirection (e.g., `command > file.txt` or `command < input.txt`).
- **Job Control**: Add job control to manage background processes.
- **Command History**: Implement command history to store and retrieve previously entered commands.
- **Tab Completion**: Implement basic tab-completion for commands and file paths.
- **Aliases**: Allow users to define custom aliases for commands.

### Acknowledgements

- The `msh` shell project was inspired by the **Codecrafters.io** tutorial series on building a shell in C. It helped me understand key concepts related to system calls, process management, and low-level programming in C.

### Final Notes

By building this shell, I gained a deep understanding of how shells work internally and how the operating system handles processes. This project was a great exercise in learning system programming, especially working with processes and system calls in Unix-like systems.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or questions. Happy coding! ðŸš€
